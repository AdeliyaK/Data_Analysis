# Data_Analysis
Description:
This project revolves around the analysis of transportation infrastructure, developed in collaboration with professors from the Technical University of Sofia, Plovdiv Branch. Thus far, I have implemented data clustering using the K-means method after removing invalid values. Currently, the focus is on translating all data into valid formats and then constructing a machine learning algorithm to predict the road infrastructure.
